# Claude Configuration

## Language Settings
- All conversations with Claude Code should be conducted in Korean.

## Xcode Project Settings
- When adding new targets or making significant changes to project configurations, I will guide you to use Xcode's built-in features. You will perform these actions directly within the Xcode IDE. This approach is safer and less error-prone than modifying the `.pbxproj` file manually.
